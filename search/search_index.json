Use Descriptive Names \u00b6 # Good function calculate_total_price ( items , tax_rate ) # ... end # Less clear function calc ( x , y ) # ... end 2. Keep Functions Focused \u00b6 # Good: Each function does one thing function calculate_subtotal ( items ) # Calculate subtotal end function calculate_tax ( subtotal , tax_rate ) # Calculate tax end function calculate_total ( subtotal , tax ) # Calculate total end # Less good: Function does too much function process_order ( items , tax_rate , discount ) # Calculates everything at once end 3. Document Complex Functions \u00b6 function calculate_compound_interest ( principal , rate , time , frequency ) # Calculate compound interest # principal: initial amount # rate: annual interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%) # time: number of years # frequency: times compounded per year let amount = principal * pow ( 1 + rate / frequency , frequency * time ) return amount end 4. Validate Inputs \u00b6 function divide ( a , b ) if b == 0 print ( \"Error: Cannot divide by zero\" ) return nil end return a / b end Common Patterns \u00b6 Function as Helper \u00b6 function print_separator () print ( \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" + \"=\" ) end print_separator () print ( \"Report\" ) print_separator () Function with Default Behavior \u00b6 function greet_user ( name ) if name == nil or name == \"\" name = \"Guest\" end print ( \"Welcome, \" + name + \"!\" ) end greet_user ( \"Alice\" ) # Welcome, Alice! greet_user ( \"\" ) # Welcome, Guest!
