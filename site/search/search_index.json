Variable Errors \u00b6 Undefined Variable \u00b6 Error Message: Undefined variable: variable_name Cause: Trying to use a variable that hasn't been declared with let . Examples: # Wrong print ( name ) # name not declared # Right let name = \"Alice\" print ( name ) Solution: Always declare variables with let before using them. Invalid Variable Declaration \u00b6 Error Message: Invalid variable declaration Cause: Incorrect let statement syntax. Examples: # Wrong let x # Missing value let = 5 # Missing variable name x = 5 # Missing 'let' for first declaration # Right let x = 5 Solution: Use the format let variable_name = value . Function Errors \u00b6 Function Not Defined \u00b6 Error Message: Function 'function_name' not defined Cause: Calling a function that doesn't exist. Examples: # Wrong my_function () # Function doesn't exist # Right function my_function () print ( \"Hello\" ) end my_function () Solution: Define the function before calling it, or check the spelling. Expected '(' \u00b6 Error Message: Expected '(' Cause: Missing parentheses in function call or definition. Examples: # Wrong function greet name print ( name ) end # Wrong print \"Hello\" # Right function greet ( name ) print ( name ) end print ( \"Hello\" ) Solution: Always include parentheses for function calls and definitions. Expected 'end' \u00b6 Error Message: Expected 'end' Cause: Missing end keyword to close a block. Examples: # Wrong function greet () print ( \"Hello\" ) # Missing 'end' # Wrong if x > 5 print ( \"Big\" ) # Missing 'end' # Right function greet () print ( \"Hello\" ) end if x > 5 print ( \"Big\" ) end Solution: Every function, if, while, and for block needs an end keyword. Type Errors \u00b6 Cannot Convert to Integer \u00b6 Error Message: Cannot convert 'value' to integer Cause: Trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer. Examples: # Wrong let num = int ( \"hello\" ) # Right try let num = int ( \"hello\" ) except error print ( \"Invalid number\" ) end # Or with valid input let num = int ( \"42\" ) Solution: Validate input before conversion or use try-except blocks. Cannot Convert to Float \u00b6 Error Message: Cannot convert 'value' to float Cause: Trying to convert a non-numeric string to a float. Examples: # Wrong let num = float ( \"abc\" ) # Right try let num = float ( \"abc\" ) except error print ( \"Invalid number\" ) end Solution: Use try-except or validate input first. List Errors \u00b6 List Index Out of Range \u00b6 Error Message: Index out of range Cause: Accessing a list index that doesn't exist. Examples: let fruits = [ \"apple\" , \"banana\" ] # Wrong print ( fruits [ 5 ]) # Only indices 0-1 exist # Right if len ( fruits ) > 5 print ( fruits [ 5 ]) else print ( \"Index too large\" ) end Solution: Check list length before accessing indices. Item Not Found in List \u00b6 Error Message: Item 'value' not found in list Cause: Trying to remove an item that doesn't exist. Examples: let fruits = [ \"apple\" , \"banana\" ] # Wrong remove ( fruits , \"cherry\" ) # cherry not in list # Right try remove ( fruits , \"cherry\" ) except error print ( \"Item not found\" ) end Solution: Check if item exists before removing, or use try-except. Cannot Pop from Empty List \u00b6 Error Message: Cannot pop from empty list Cause: Trying to pop from a list with no items. Examples: let items = [] # Wrong let item = pop ( items ) # Right if len ( items ) > 0 let item = pop ( items ) else print ( \"List is empty\" ) end Solution: Check list length before popping. Dictionary Errors \u00b6 Key Not Found \u00b6 Error Message: Key 'key_name' not found Cause: Accessing a dictionary key that doesn't exist. Examples: let person = { \"name\" : \"Alice\" } # Wrong print ( person [ \"age\" ]) # age key doesn't exist # Right try print ( person [ \"age\" ]) except error print ( \"Age not found\" ) end Solution: Check if key exists or use try-except blocks. Expression Errors \u00b6 Cannot Evaluate Expression \u00b6 Error Message: Cannot evaluate expression: ... Cause: Invalid expression syntax or operation. Examples: # Wrong let result = 5 + * 3 # Invalid operators # Wrong let x = ( 5 + 3 # Unmatched parentheses # Right let result = 5 + 3 let x = ( 5 + 3 ) * 2 Solution: Check expression syntax and operator usage. Division by Zero \u00b6 Error Message: Division by zero Cause: Attempting to divide by zero. Examples: # Wrong let result = 10 / 0 # Right let divisor = 0 if divisor != 0 let result = 10 / divisor else print ( \"Cannot divide by zero\" ) end Solution: Check for zero before dividing. Import Errors \u00b6 Library Not Found \u00b6 Error Message: Library 'library_name' not found Cause: Trying to import a library that doesn't exist. Examples: # Wrong import nonexistent # Right import random # Built-in library Solution: Only import built-in libraries (currently: random ). Function Not Found in Library \u00b6 Error Message: Library 'library' has no function 'function_name' Cause: Calling a function that doesn't exist in the library. Examples: import random # Wrong let num = random . nonexistent () # Right let num = random . randint ( 1 , 10 ) Solution: Check the library documentation for available functions. Control Flow Errors \u00b6 Invalid 'if' Statement \u00b6 Error Message: Invalid if statement Cause: Incorrect if statement syntax. Examples: # Wrong if print ( \"Hello\" ) end # Wrong if x # Missing comparison print ( \"Hello\" ) end # Right if x > 5 print ( \"Hello\" ) end Solution: Include a condition after if . Invalid 'while' Loop \u00b6 Error Message: Invalid while loop Cause: Incorrect while loop syntax. Examples: # Wrong while print ( \"Hello\" ) end # Right while x < 10 print ( x ) x += 1 end Solution: Include a condition after while . Invalid 'for' Loop \u00b6 Error Message: Invalid for loop / Expected 'in' in for loop Cause: Incorrect for loop syntax. Examples: # Wrong for item fruits print ( item ) end # Right for item in fruits print ( item ) end Solution: Use the format for variable in iterable . Common Mistake Patterns \u00b6 Forgetting String Conversion \u00b6 # Wrong let age = 25 print ( \"Age: \" + age ) # Error: can't concatenate int to string # Right let age = 25 print ( \"Age: \" + str ( age )) Using = Instead of == \u00b6 # Wrong if x = 5 # Assignment, not comparison print ( \"Five\" ) end # Right if x == 5 # Comparison print ( \"Five\" ) end Missing Quotes for Strings \u00b6 # Wrong let name = Alice # Treated as variable # Right let name = \"Alice\" # String literal Incorrect Indentation Confusion \u00b6 # Indentation is optional in Tourmaline # But 'end' keywords are required # Wrong if condition print ( \"Yes\" ) # Missing 'end' # Right if condition print ( \"Yes\" ) end Debugging Tips \u00b6 1. Read the Error Message Carefully \u00b6 Error messages usually indicate: - What went wrong - Where it happened (which line or expression) - What was expected 2. Check Common Issues \u00b6 Missing let for variable declaration Missing end keywords Typos in variable/function names Missing quotes around strings Missing str() when concatenating 3. Use Print Statements \u00b6 # Debug by printing values print ( \"x is: \" + str ( x )) print ( \"Type of x: \" + type ( x )) 4. Test Small Parts \u00b6 # Test expressions separately let a = 5 let b = 3 print ( a + b ) # Make sure this works let result = a + b 5. Use Try-Except for Testing \u00b6 try # Test risky code here let result = int ( user_input ) except error print ( \"Error occurred: \" + error ) end Getting Help \u00b6 If you encounter an error not listed here: Check the syntax reference - Syntax Reference Review examples - Examples Report the issue - GitHub Issues Prevention Checklist \u00b6 Before running your code, check: [ ] All variables declared with let [ ] All blocks closed with end [ ] All function calls have parentheses [ ] String concatenation uses str() for non-strings [ ] Comparisons use == not = [ ] List indices are within bounds [ ] Division operations check for zero [ ] Input is validated before conversion Remember: Error messages are helpful!
